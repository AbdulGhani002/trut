              What is TRUT?
            </h2>

              <p>
                TRUT is a strategic card game that combines elements of bluffing, psychology, and tactical play. 
                The goal is to win tricks by playing the highest card, but the twist is that you can challenge 
                your opponent&apos;s claims with a &quot;TRUT&quot; call.
              </p>
              <p>
                The game uses a 32-card deck (7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A in all four suits) and can be played 
                in 1v1 or 2v2 team formats.

                <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-white mb-2">1. Starting the Game</h3>
                <p>Each player receives cards from a shuffled deck. Players take turns playing one card at a time to form a &quot;trick&quot;.</p>
              </div>
              
              <div>

                <p>On your turn, select a card from your hand to play. The card with the highest strength wins the trick.</p>
              </div>
              
              <div>
                <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-white mb-2">3. Winning Tricks</h3>
                <p>The player who plays the highest card wins the trick and becomes the next player to lead. If there&apos;s a tie (same rank), it becomes a &quot;rotten trick&quot; and no one wins.</p>

                <p>At any point, you can call &quot;TRUT&quot; to challenge your opponent. This forces them to either accept the challenge (play for the trick) or fold (give up the trick).</p>
